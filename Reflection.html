    Lord Murry the Great and Cringy, with your Sonic foot fetish and unkempt beard. I do declare I have throughly enjoyed thoust class this year. It has honestly brought me great joy and I feel I now know more than I ever could have hoped to learn elsewhere. I may not be your student next year, but I may email you once in a while for advice. Overall thank you for a fantastic class this year. I will miss you.

I enjoyed learning Linux the best, as a true Vim-chad, I have learned much about the art of shortcuts and the way of the termianl. Without you I would never know the destructive power of sudo rm -rf /. Thank you Murry for all you've done for me.

C was a fun one, nothing like having to deal with the gcc compiler and figuring that sucker out. Painfully truly, but enjoyable none the less, also worth mentioning C+ is a much easier and simpler language that expands on it, Python is better but C is still based.

You didn't teach this to the class but rather directly to me. The art of ed. Oh my god, MURRY IT HURTS MY BRAIN. I have managed to learn this thing and now use it on the rare occasion when I screw around with Assembly. Yes I write in Assembly with ed, only time I use those two, is together. That'll be something to show off at a job interview. Once more thank you for all you've done Daddy Murry, you will be missied.
